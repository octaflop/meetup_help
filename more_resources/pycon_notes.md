* Has anyone tried doing childcare with their meetups?
   * Faris: We tried it twice, but the childcare provider went under
   * IndyPy: we let members bring kids, and it hasn’t been a problem
   * Faris: kids that stay quiet can enter a raffle
* Slack
   * Jeff: It’s okay if we lose more than 10k messages
   * Edminton: One workspace in Slack and each community groups are all in the same Slack
   * Indianpolis has one workspace for Python and one for everyone else; Python is so big
* PSF will sponsor meetup fees and do it on a recurring basis 
   * They’ll also let you ride on their 501c3 and cover insurance for big events
   * Faris: we went our own route because we wanted control
   * PSF takes 10%
* Has anybody brought in speakers from out of state?
   * Faris: Dan Callahan was passing through SLC
   * Frederick: Virtual one using YouTube Live. Worked really well. We meet at a college so we can use all that.
   * IndyPy: 6 feet up run IndyPy have a meetup in a box at their booth
   * Asheesh: maybe the PSF would probably let you expense it
* How many come from guest speakers vs from membership?
   * Boston: most of their talks are from membership. One of the organizers specifically asks the attendees and helps craft talks.
   * Edinton: collaboration across meetups.
   * Faris: every new member has to introduce themselves. It’s enough of a nudge to get people speaking.
   * Edinton: lightning talk days help get people into speaking.
* Does anyone do BYOP — bring your own python?
   * IndyPy: fishbowl question style; we use them for open discussion. So you can easily kick someone out if the topic gets disrailed.
      * A fishbowl has 3-5 chairs in the front of the room. To ask a question or asnwer a quesiotn you have to be in a chair.
      * Everyone submits a form beforehand for a topic and you’ll pick the top 3 topics. Have 10 minutes per topic. Organizer taps out the expert so people feel comfortable tapping people out.
   * Chippy: challenge projects and these are available online
   * Question panel to help answer quesitons
   * Boston: I like the idea of open discussion
* To Boston: How does project night work?
   * Tables organized by topic: web dev, machine learning, beginners tables
   * Basic premise people can self-organize by topic of interest
   * At the beginning people can raise their hand and say this is what I’m working on and what I need help with or what I can help with
   * IndyPy: we have a similar thing. Sometimes we have too many beginners which causes a problem cuz we don’t have projects for everyone. 
      * Boston: we don’t have set projects for people
   * BostonPytohn is one of the greatest ways to meet people.
   * Chippy: we also do them. 
   * SF: we do special interest groups that are longer term projects in the context of a project night. There’s a group leader and they can run workshops for the year. We see a good amount of people returning to these.
   * Chippy: shy hack night in Chicago, is civic tech, and they have long running projects that people can contribue to
   * How much structure is in these project nights? Are there pre-made materials?
      * Chippy: we have a number of projects that we use for people to learn Python. It’s like Blue Clue’s.
      * Having a catcher’s mitt for the new people is good. Having a quick pitch.
      * Faris: Front loading networking has been good; first 30min is networking and food but talks start at 7p.
      * Chippy: we do the same thing. 
      * Newcastle: we frontload food as well.
      * IndyPy: our project nights aren’t structured really. Our hack night night is 5-10 and you can come and go as you please. Door is locked til 4:59 so early people don’t show. We get a lot of new people because they can come when they can.
* Faris: when are your meetups?
   * IndyPy: 2 lunch and learns.
   * Chippy: has a during the day meetup.
   * Most are during the day after work.
   * Some weekends on morning.
   * Faris: for us it was all about traffic. We moved our meetup downtown to go opposite flow of traffic.
   * LA: it just doesn’t work because of traffic. Most of our events are on the west side because tech co’s are there. Realistically we should have one every 10 miles lol. OC Python is 2.5 hours from SoCal. Culver City is weekly—nice to intro y’all SoCal and Culver City.
   * IndyPy: we outgrew the space that we’ve been using for 11 years. We were consistently getting 100-120 people. The only space we could get for a decent price is in a difficult place to get to—and now it’s dropping.
   * Newcastle has capped their people at 40 due to organizing team constraints. Rule: no speaker, no pizza. 
* Meetup cross pollination in an area?
   * Newcastle: Cross promotion in Newcastle. Single Slack.
   * Faris: we advertise across meetups.
* Faris: can we link together meetups across towns?
   * A number of meetups  are on Wednesday evenings. 
* How do you manage dues?
   * Faris: we ask for an optional $5 donation. Students are free. Local ISP has been funding anything we do. Annual fundraising event. Does anyone do a once a year celebration?
      * Newcastle: yes we have one in December.
      * SF: we have a holiday party in December.
   * Have people found creative ways of getting money?
      * Ask the recruiters that are recruiting you. They can do an announcement for a few minutes for $.
* How do you find venues?
   * Chippy: in January, cold calls. Lots of emails. Provide them a prospectus. Don’t sign up for one, sign up for 2 or 3 since the 1st one will be hard but the other 2 will be easier.
   * Frederick: we do local colleges. Partner with CS department.
   * Newcastle: talk to other meetups in the area.
   * Elizabeth (champaign illinois Python): me who’s the loud one, and the other organizer does github things. Saturday afternoon meetups, 1-3p. We have a lot of regulars since switching from Tuesdays. We partner with our local makerspace; we’re keyholders to the space so we don’t have to pay for space and the PSF through financial assist (see above). I can run it once a week with like 0 hustle and 0 cost.
   * Faris: your local library. 
   * IndyPy: libraries probably have resources and things available.
   * BostonPython: we’re blessed in Boston that companies are really interested in hosting. Tech companies.
   * Chippy: where your members are working.
   * IndyPy: we keep track of all the hiring that happens due to our meetup. We take those numbers to potential sponsors. 
   * How do you track that?
      * IndyPy: it’s only 100 people, I’m loud.
      * Chippy: we’ve been talking about whether our referral program works. If we refer someone to your company, it’s $1000 which is way cheaper.
      * Faris: write it down publicly. 
* BostonPython: should we do smaller weekly things as well as / instead of the large one?
* How do you deal with funds?
   * Most meetups are PSF.
   * Faris we have our own 501c3. Any thing is logged on Meetup.
   * Being a part of the PSF helps with the accounting business. 
   * I think there’s also a credit card from PSF.
   * DjangoBoston: there’s a standard rate for pizzas for the meeting. On average, it adds a little bit of surplus each time so we can cover future events
   * Edmonton: that was one of the reasons why we formed the non profit for our town.
   * Faris: all of Utah is under the same 501c3 for Python
   * Newcastle: we don’t have a bank account. The business pays vendors directly. 
   * Faris: we need to log it even if we did that.
   * Chippy: we’re not a 501c3 in Illinois yet. This is not financial advice. A lot of companies don’t particularly care for 501c3.
* Chippy: I created an open source slackbot called Busybeaver. I want to get it out to other workspaces in the next couple months. Are you sprinting? Yes Monday and Tuesday.
   * Right now it GitHub activity sharer. 
   * https://github.com/alysivji/busy-beaver
* Newcastle: tell recruiters that get in touch with you to have one of their employees give a talk to help facilitate the recruiting process.
   * Chippy: for hosts we give away a speaker slot.
* Edmonton: does anyone have a decent turnout for underrepresented groups in the community?
   * Chippy: improving our CoC, mentorship, and partnering with PyLadies. 
   * Faris: university helped push some people their way.
   * IndyPy: the main sponsor of ours is founded by a woman.
* BostonDjango: who’s interested in continuing this conversation after the conference?
   * How do we do this? Mailing list group-organizers@python.org
   * Faris: I’ll add a resources repo.
