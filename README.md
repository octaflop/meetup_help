## A note

The human being who wrote this really tried to keep his commit messages clean, but soon fell into a state of despair at the prospect of having to present themselves both digitally and physically. So here's the raw digital part with it's messy commit messages and evolutions of a quickly little PyCon presentation.

As such, I'm placing this talk and this repo into the public with the knowledge and understanding that you, the cohort dev, understand that I'm still working on cleaning this up a bit.

# Thank you ðŸ™‡
